# Welcome to your first repository!

Nice that you made it. In this course you will work a lot with repositories so
you better start to like them as soon as possible ;)

In this course everything will be centered around your repository's issue tracker. Start with #1 and move on to the next one when you are finished.

We assume that you have basic knowledge about `linux bash` and `git`. If you are unsure we recommend the free bash and git courses at [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/bash).
